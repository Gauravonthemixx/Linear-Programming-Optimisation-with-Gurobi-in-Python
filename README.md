# 🚀 Linear-Programming-Optimisation-with-Gurobi-in-Python
## 📍 Description
* The code demonstrates how to formulate and solve linear programming problems using the Gurobi optimization library in Python.
  
* It optimizes for maximizing profits based on given constraints and decision variables, first with a basic model and then with an extended model considering additional profit-related variables.

## 📝 ::Importing and Setup:-

* The code starts by installing the Gurobi Python package and importing necessary modules.
* It can be downloaded from https://pypi.org/project/gurobipy/#files 🔗
